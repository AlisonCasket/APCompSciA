# Unicode Encryption
In this lab you will code to encrypt and decrypt a message 

## Introduction
You have been learning how to represent numbers in different bases - decimal, binary, hexadecimal, and octal.  And now you now how to represent letters numerically using the unicode system.  For this lab you will you these skills to encrypt and decrypt messages

## Your Tasks

- [ ] Locate the "Unicode Encryption" lab guide [UnicodeEncryption.pdf](UnicodeEncryption.pdf)

- [ ] Complete the group portion of the lab as instructed

- [ ] Complete the individual portion of the lab

	* In your AP Computer Science A Repo on your computer make sure you have created a directory called "labs"
	* Inside your labs directory, create another directory called "UnicodeEncryption"
	* Complete the challenges below
	* Once you have completed your challenges push your AP Computer Science A Repo to GitHub
	* Show your completed challenges to Ms. Pluska to receive credit for the individual portion of this lab

### Challenge 1

- [ ] The unicode system has corresponding characters for the decimal values 0 thru 65536.  Write a loop that could be used to print out all the corresponding characters.

### Challenge 2

- [ ] Consider a String of characters like “Code is Cool!”, or even your name.  Write code that could be used to convert each character in the String to its hexadecimal unicode equivalent and print the result to the consol.

### Challenge 3

- [ ] The secret message below has been encrypted with the Pluska Cipher.  Each letter is represented by three digits. For example 1E9 represents a letter in our alphabet.  For the purposes of this example, let 0 = A, 1 = B, 2 = C, etc.  _Hint_: First determine the base, then determine the modulo.   

1E90A90CE 0FA1B20E60E60A9168 0A71B20E309F 1B20E6 0A90A709F1BD09F168 0D00E11681D80A90CE168 09C1E209F1B20E30E10E613C 1B2 15A09F0D0 09F13C13C167

### Extra Credit

- [ ] Develop your own cipher and encrypt a secret message.  Have a classmate decode your secret message.  s
