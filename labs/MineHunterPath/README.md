# Mine Hunter Path

## Introduction
In this lab you will build upon the Mine Hunter game you created previously.  The goal is create a path through the mines given a starting coordinate and an ending coordinate.

## Your Tasks

- [ ] Locate the MineHunterPath lab guide [MineHunterPath.pdf](MineHunterPath.pdf)

- [ ] Complete the group portion of the lab as instructed

- [ ] Complete the individual portion of the lab

	* Make a copy of your MineHunter project in NetBeans, then rename the copy to MineHunterPath
	* I made some additions to the MineHunterGrid class, take a look at the version I have provided below and integrate these changes with the MineHunterGrid class you wrote
	* Implement challenges 1 thru 5 (To receive credit, show your working game to Ms. Pluska) (NOTE:  You do not need to implement the challenges I have subscribed, you have the freedom to combine methods or create your own. The end goal is that the MineHunterPath class, when implemented, will successfully find a path through the grid of mines. Get creative!) 
	*EXTRA CREDIT: Modify your project such that a random path can be created in 4 directions (not just two).  If you get "stuck" your program must reset and continue to look for a path until one is found.  You must be mindful of situations where no path may not exists.
