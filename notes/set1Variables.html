    <p>Variables are letters or words that can be used to store data.   Variables declared
        inside of a method are referred to as <i>local</i> variables - that is their use is
        localized to the method in which they are declared.  
    </p> 

    <p>Java is a strict variable type language.  That is, to declare a variable requires that you
        not only provide a name for the variable, but also declare the type.  To illistrate how to 
        declare a variable in Java, we will use the <i>int</i> type variable. 
    </p>
    <p>An int type variable can hold any whole number.  The following code could be used
        to declare an <i>int</i> type variable called <i>x</i>.  Notice that in the code, <i>int</i>
        is the type of variable we want to declare and <i>x</i> is the name of the variable. 
    </p>

    <p class="codeblock">int x;</p>

    <p>The variable we declared above is currently empty, that is no value has been assigned to it. 
        Assigning a value to a variable is called <i>initializing</i>.  The following code illustrates
        how to initialize the variable x. Notice in the code below, 
        
        <ul>
            <li>we did not type <i>int</i> again. 
                Once a variable is declared, it cannot be declared again.  Leaving <i>int</i> in front of our variable
                x would actually generate an error. </li>
            <li>Also, notice that the variable name is always on the left of the equal sign.  The value you want to assign
                to the variable goes on the right of the equal sign. 
            </li>
        </ul>

    </p>
    <p class="codeblock">x = 10;</p>

    <p>The value of variables can be changed at any point in the method in which they were declared.
        For example, the code below, would change the value of x to 5.
    </p>
    <p class="codeblock">x = 5;</p>
    <p>Variables can also be manipulated.  For example I could add 1 to variable x as follows, 
    </p>
        <p class="codeblock">x = x + 1;</p>

    <p>The naming convention for variables in java is "lower camel case".  That is, the first letter
        in the variable is lower case.  If there are multiple words associated with the variable name, they
        are run together.  Each word in the variable (except for the first word) is capatilized. Consider the
        example below.  In this example, we have declared and initialized the variable on one line. 
    </p>
    <p class="codeblock">int myFinalScore = 10;</p>

    <p>To print the value of a variable to the console, we use the same print statement we learned previously. The 
        following code could be used to print <i>myFinalScore</i>.  Notice in the below example, there are no quotes 
        around the variable.  If there were quotes around myFinalScore, "myFinalScore" is what would be printed.  Leaving
        the quotes off, prints the value of the variable. 
    </p>
    <p class="codeblock">System.out.prinlnt(myFinalScore);</p>

<div id="skill2" class="skills">Skill 1.2 Describe the 8 primitive data types</div>
<div class="skillConceptsHeader">Skill 1.2 Concepts</div>
<div class="skillConcepts">
        <p> There are eight primitive variable types in the Java language.
            These variable types are the most basic data types available within the 
            Java language and serve as the building blocks of data manipulation.  
            Primitive variable types serve only one purpose â€” to contain pure, 
            simple values of a kind. Because these data types are defined 
            into the Java type system by default, they come with a number of 
            operations predefined. 
        </p>
        <p>Primitive number type variables are divided into two groups:
                <p><b>Integer</b> types stores whole numbers, positive or negative (such as 123 or -456), without decimals. Valid types are byte, short, int and long. Which type you should use, depends on the numeric value.</p>
                <p>The four types of Integer types are described below.  Each of the Integer types store whole numbers.  
                        The only difference is the range of numbers they can store. 
                    </p>

      <li>boolean</li>
      <li>char (Although not required of AP, we will utilize this in future projects)</li>

<div class="skillConcepts">
        <p>As aforementioned, the three variable types you MUST know for the AP Exam are int, double, and boolean.  But, 
            because we use the char variable type in upcoming projects, you should be familiar with the use of this data type
            too.  The code segment below illustrates how to declare and initialize each of these variable types,

                            char aCharValue = 'a';</p>

        <ul>
                <li>Notice that all the variable declarations above begin with a type declaration followed by an equal sign </li>
                <li>The value of the variable appears to the right of the equal sign.  
                </li>
                <li>The <i>char</i>variable type requires single quotes around the value.  
                    </li>
            </ul>

    <div id="skill4" class="skills">1.4 Interchange int and double variable types</div>
    <div class="skillConceptsHeader">Skill 1.4 Concepts</div>
    <div class="skillConcepts">
     <p>Recall that an <i>int</i> variable type is a whole number.  Whereas a <i>double</i> is a decimal type number
     </p>

     <p>When a value is assigned to a double type variable, Java automatically assigns zeros after the digit.  
         This makes this type of variable more precise (1.000 for example, is more precise than just 1).  Because 
         a double is more precise than an int, you cannot assign a double to an int, however the reverse is
         allowed.  Consider the following example,
     </p>

     <p class="codeblock">int i = 1;<br>
                        double d = 2;<br>
                        d = i; //allowed because i is an int and is not precise<br>
                        i = d; //<b>not</b> allowed because d is a double and cannot be assigned to an int<br>
                        i = 2.0000; //<b>not</b> allowed because 2.0000 is too precise

    </p>
     
     <p>The reason for the above assignment rules is that while asigning an int to a double does not cause a loss
         in precision or information, assigning a double to an int does. Likewise you may not assign a decimal precision
         number to an int type variable. If you try this, you will get the following error, 
     </p>
     <p class="codeblock">error: incompatible types: possible lossy conversion from double to int<br>
            int i = 2.000;<br>
                    
    1 error
    </p>

    <p>You can however <b>force</b> a <i>double</i> type variable into an <i>int</i> type variable with <b>casting</b>. 
    The following code snippet illustrates how to cast a <i>double</i> type variable into an <i>int</i>, 
    </p>

    <p class="codeblock">int i = 1;<br>
        double d = 2.9999;<br>
        d = i; //allowed because i is an int and is not precise<br>
        i = (int)d; //<b>allowed</b> because we <b>casted</b> variable d to an int<br>
        i = (int)2.0000; //<b>allowed</b> because we <b>casted</b> 2.0000 to an int<br>

</p>

<p>Be careful with the above operation however, because <i>int</i> type variables cut off
all information following the decimal and only preserve the "ones" place.  Converting 2.9999 to an int for 
example, would result in 2.  Rounding does NOT apply to int variables - all numbers after the decimal 
are simply chopped off.</p>
