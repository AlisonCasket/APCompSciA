        <p>
                Suppose that for some reason, we had a programming task that was to model animals. For
                example, we want to have a class for a cat, a class for a dog, a class for a horse, and so forth. As
                you can imagine, there could be lots of redundancy among those classes because animals have
                some common characteristics. For instance, all animals have, say, two eyes, or two ears, and
                make sounds, and so forth. Or at least all the animals that we would like to model do.
        </p>
        <p>
                We could create a super class called animal to capture all these common characteristics and
                behaviors. And then we could have all the specific animal classes derive from the animal class.
                So far so good…
        </p>
        <p>
                The question though is, what would new animal mean? In other words, if we create an object of
                the animal class, what kind of object would that be? What would we try to model by creating an
                object of the animal class?
        </p>
        <p>
                You may be thinking there is no point in creating objects from the animal class, so there is no
                need to ever invoke the animal constructor. But subclasses could benefit from extending such a
                class.
        </p>
        <p>
                Java prohibits, under some circumstances, creating objects from specific classes. Such classes are
                referred to as abstract classes. Abstract classes are classes that cannot be instantiated – objects
                cannot be created from abstract classes. While the methods abstract classes carry may be
                implemented, methods declared as abstract cannot be implemented by the abstract class, they
                must instead be implemented by the subclass. Such methods can provide a framework for a
                subclass.
        </p>

        <div class="skillTakeAway"><p>Methods declared as abstract cannot be implemented by the abstract class, they

<div class="skillConceptsHeader">Skill 26.2 Concepts</div>
<div class="skillConcepts">
<p>Abstract classes are implemented using the keyword <strong>abstract</strong></p>
<p>In the below example, we have created an abstract class called <em>animal</em></p>
    <div class="codeblock"> 
        <p>public abstract class Animal
        <br>{</p>  
        <p>//methods and fields</p>     
        <p>}</p>    
    </div>
<p>As previously mentioned, abstract classes can provide the frameword for a subclass.  
    For example, consider the following subclasses which inherit the animal class,
</p>
    <div class="codeblock"> 
        <p>public class Cow extends Animal
        <br>{</p>  
        <p>//methods and fields</p>     
        <p>}</p>    

        <p>public class Dog extends Animal
        <br>{</p>  
        <p>//methods and fields</p>     
        <p>}</p>    
     
        <p>public class Cat extends Animal
        <br>{</p>  
        <p>//methods and fields</p>     
        <p>}</p>    
    </div>
<p>Each of the classes that inherit the parent class, Animal, have some common characteristics.
    For example, a Cow, a Dog, and a Cat, all have two eyes, two ears, and
    make sounds, and so forth. But these charasterics are different for each animal we 
    want to model.
    
</p>
<p>Suppose we want to ensure that every animal we model can speak.   To do this, we would
    write an abstract method in our abstract class.  
</p>
<div class="codeblock"> 
        <p>public abstract class Animal
        <br>{</p>  
        <p>     public abstract void speak();</p>     
        <p>}</p>    
</div>
<p>Notice we have only declared the abstract method, but we did not implement it.  In fact,
    Java does not allow for this.   However, the classes that inherit the Animal class <em>must</em>
    implement the speak method.</p>
</p>

<p>This is illustrated below,</p>

    <p>
        The above illustrates how abstract classes can serve as a framework for subclasses.  
        In addition to abstract methods, abstract classes can also include regular methods.
        For example, all the animals in our subclasses have four legs, therefore we can 
        create a method to return the number of legs in the parent class. 
    </p>
    <div class="codeblock"> 
            <p>public abstract class Animal
            <br>{</p>  
            <p>     public abstract void speak();</p>  
            <p>     public String getLegs(){<br>
                        return "Four";<br>
                    }
            </p>

<div class="skillConceptsHeader">Skill 26.3 Concepts</div>
<div class="skillConcepts">

    <p>An interface is an abstract super class that contains only abstract methods.  
        Consider the following example.
    </p>
    <p>The super class:</p>
    <div class = "codeblock">
            <p>public abstract class Parent<br>
            {<br>
            public abstract void method1();<br>
            public abstract void method2();<br>
            public abstract int method3(double d);<br>
            }</p>
    </div>
    <p>And now the subclass:</p>
    <div class = "codeblock">
            <p>public class Child extends Parent<br>
            {<br>
            public void method1(){ … some code … }<br>
            public void method2(){ … some code … }<br>
            public int method3()(double c) { … some code … }<br>
            }</p>
    </div>
    <p>Notice that in the above example, the super class does nothing. In other words, all methods in the
    super class are abstract. Moreover, there are no variables which need to be accessed. The only
    purpose of the super class is to force the subclass to implement its methods. If this is all a
    particular super class does, then the “abstract” declaration can be replaced with an interface as
    shown below,</p>

    <div class="codeblock">
        <p>
                public interface Parent<br>
                {<br>
                void method1();<br>
                void method2();<br>
                int method3(double d);<br>
                }
        </p>

    Because the MountainBike class extends the Bicycle class, MountainBike is able to access all the public methods and variables associated with Bicycle.   
    This concept is illustrated below,

<div class="skillConceptsHeader">Skill 25.5 Concepts</div>
<div class="skillConcepts">
<p>The inheritance of one class from another follows an "IS A" relationship.  That is, a mountain bike "IS A" bicycle.  The reverse is not true however.  For example, a bike is
    not necessarily a mountain bike.  When creating objects from super and sub classes, this relatioinship becomes important. 
</p>
<p>Consider the following hierarchy of inherited classes between bicycles</p>
<img src = "../images/inheritanceRelationships.png">

<p>The above heirarchy shows the relationship among the classes in a program.  According to the heirarchy 
    <ul>
        <li>CrossCountryBike "IS A" MountainBike</li>
        <li>DownhillBike "IS A" MountainBike</li>
        <li>MountainBike "IS A" Bicycle</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>When creating objects from super and sub classes this relationsihp is enforced.  This is illustrated below,

<p>Another way to think of this is that "parents can make children, but children cannot make parents"</p>

<div class="skillConceptsHeader">Skill 25.6 Concepts</div>
<div class="skillConcepts">
    <p>Any time when a parameter is expecting to receive an object of a particular type, it is acceptable
            to send it an object of the same class or a subclass, but never of a superclass. This is because the passed class
            object inherits all the methods of the object. If you attempt to pass an object of a parent class, the expected object may not
            have all the expected methods. Consider the following hierarchy of classes where each class is a
            subclass of the class immediately above it.</p>
    <img src = "../images/inheritanceHierarchy.png">

    <p>Suppose there is a method with the following signature:</p>
    <div class="codeblock"> 
            <p>public void theMethod(Male ml)</p>   
    </div>
    <p>The method theMethod is clearly expecting a Male object; therefore, the following calls to this
            method would be legal since we are either sending a Male object or an object of a subclass:</p>

    <div class = "codeblock">
            <p>Male m = new Male();</p>
            <p>theMethod(m); //ok to send m since it’s expecting a Male object</p>
            <p>Boy b = new Boy();</p>
            <p>theMethod(b); //ok to send b since b is created from a subclass of Male</p>
    </div>
    <p>Since theMethod is expecting a Male object, we can’t send an object of a superclass.</p>
    <div class = "codeblock">
            <p>Person p = new Person();</p> 
            <p>theMethod(p); //Illegal</p>
