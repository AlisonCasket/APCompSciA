            <p>In our previous lesson we learned how arrays can be applied to store lists of data.  In this 
                lesson we will explore some additional features associated with arrays, along with how they can be 
                manipulated and applied to represent complex data sets. 
            </p>

            <p>Believe it or not you have been declaring arrays since your first program.  Consider 
                the following code you have been using to declare the main method in all your programs, 
            </p>

            <p class = "codeblock">
                public static void main(<span style="color:red;">String args[]</span>){}
            </p>
            <p>Now that we know about arrays, we can see the <span style="color:red;">String args[]</span> 
                is declaring args as a String array.  In fact, the name of the array, <i>args</i> could be
                called by any legal variable name. </p>
            <p>But where and how is this <i>args[]</i> array to be used? </p>
            <p>The <i>args[]</i> array allows us to pass command line arguments to the main method. Consider the 
            main method in a class called <i>Street.java</i>, where the array name <i>args</i> has been replaced with <i>houses</i></p>
            <p class = "codeblock">

                    public static void main(<span style="color:red;">String houses[]</span>){}
                    
            </p>

            <p>The houses array could be populated directly from the command line using the following syntax</p>

            <p class = "codeblock">
                    java Street Bart Kyle Bugs Marvin
            </p>
            <p>After compiling <i>Street.java</i> and running the command above, our houses array has the following 
                assignments, 
            </p>

    <div class="skillConcepts">
    <p>A null pointer exception results when you try to access the value of an array object that has not
            yet been initialized. In the following example, the <i>houses</i> array is declare, but it 
            has not been initialized.  Attempting to assign "Homer" to a location in the array results
            in a <i>NullPointerException</i>.
    </p>
    
    <p class = "codeblock">
            String houses[]; //the array houses has been declared, but <i>not</i> initialized<br>
            houses[6] = "Homer"; //results in a NullPointerException

    <div id="skill3" class="skills">Skill 16.3 Use the split method to produce an array</div>
    <div class="skillConceptsHeader">Skill 16.3 Concepts</div>
    <div class="skillConcepts">
    <p>
    The split method is useful for splitting a String into separate elements and storing the result as a String array.
    The signature for the split method is below.  
    </p>
    <p class = "codeblock">
            <span style="color:red;">public String[]</span> 
            <span style="color:blue;">split</span>
            (<span style="color:green;">String regex</span>)
    </p>
    <ul style="margin-left:5em;">
        <li><span style="color:red;">public String[]</span> - the value returned when the method is implemented</li>
        <li><span style="color:blue;">split</span> - the name of the method</li>
        <li><span style="color:green;">String regex</span> - the expression that indicates where the split should occur</li>

    </ul>
    <p>The <i>regex</i> (regular expression) indicates where the split can occur.  This expression can specify that the split
        occur at one character or multiple characters.  Both
        scenarios are described below. 
    </p>
    <u>One character</u>
    <p>Consider the String people as declared below.  Because the people are separated by commas, we can easily
        split the String into an array by setting the <i>regex</i> expression equal to ",".
    </p>
    <p>Below is an example,</p>

    <p class = "codeblock">
            String people = "Bart, Kyle, Bugs, Marvin";<br>
            String houses[] = people.split(",");
    </p>
    <p>After implementing the code above, our houses have the following assignments, 
    </p>
    <img src="../images/arrayOfToons.jpg">
    <p><u>Multiple characters</u></p>
    <p>The split method can be applied to split a String at multiple locations.  Consider the 
        same String as before, but instead we have separated the people with different characters.  The String 
        can still be separated, but we need to indicate all the characters where the split should occur.
        In the code below each character in the <i>regex</i> expression is separated by a "|".  This 
        symbole stands for "or"; 
    </p>
    <p class = "codeblock">
            String people = "Bart~Kyle,Bugs-Marvin";<br>
            String houses[] = people.split("~|,|-");<br><br>
    
            System.out.println(houses[0]);//prints Bart<br>
            System.out.println(houses[1]);//prints Kyle<br>
            System.out.println(houses[2]);//prints Bugs<br>
            System.out.println(houses[3]);//prints Marvin
    </p>
    <p>Regular expression are a very important tool in programming and they can become quite complex.
