        <p><strong>Inheritance</strong> is an important pillar of OOP(Object Oriented Programming). 
            It is the mechanism in java by which one class is allow to inherit the features(fields and methods) of another class.</p>

            <p><strong>Important Terminology</strong></p>
            <ul>
                    <li><strong>Super Class</strong>: The class whose features are inherited is known as super class(or a base class or a parent class).</li>
                    <li><strong>Sub Class</strong>: The class that inherits the other class is known as sub class(or a derived class, extended class, or child class). 
                        The subclass can add its own fields and methods in addition to the superclass fields and methods.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reusability</strong>: Inheritance supports the concept of “reusability”, i.e. when we want to create a new class 
                        and there is already a class that includes some of the code that we want, we can derive our new class from the existing class. 
                        By doing this, we are reusing the fields and methods of the existing class.</li>
            </ul>

 
        <p>We have already explored and used int, double, Boolean, and char data types. Below are a few
        more,</p>
        <ul>
        <li>long: an integer which gives more digits than an int</li>
        <li>short: an integer which gives fewer digits than an int</li>
        <li>float: a floating point number (a double is also a floating point number) that gives fewer
        significant figures than an double</li>
        </ul>   

        <p>Primitive data types always store a value</p>

        <p><strong>Reference</strong> data types are objects and do not store values, but instead point to a <em>reference</em> (or location) in the memory. Objects include
        arrays and Strings; they also include classes.</p>
        <p>The video below provides further explanation,</p>
